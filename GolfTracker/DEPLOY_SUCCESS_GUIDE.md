# ‚úÖ Your App is Ready to Deploy!

## What We Fixed:
1. ‚úÖ Removed sandbox restrictions that were blocking the build
2. ‚úÖ Pre-bundled JavaScript to avoid permission errors  
3. ‚úÖ Reinstalled all iOS dependencies cleanly
4. ‚úÖ Generated all necessary native code

## Deploy to Your iPhone NOW:

### In Xcode (already open):

1. **Connect your iPhone** via USB cable

2. **In the top bar of Xcode:**
   - Make sure `GolfTracker` scheme is selected (should already be)
   - Click the device selector (shows "Any iOS Device" or similar)
   - Select YOUR iPhone from the list

3. **Clean the build:**
   - Press `Shift+Cmd+K` (or Product menu ‚Üí Clean Build Folder)

4. **Build and Run:**
   - Press `Cmd+R` (or click the Play ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button)

## If You See "Untrusted Developer":
On your iPhone:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí VPN & Device Management
2. Find your developer profile
3. Tap "Trust [Your Name]"

## If You See "Developer Mode Required":
On your iPhone:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security
2. Scroll down to Developer Mode
3. Toggle it ON
4. Restart your iPhone
5. Try building again

## If Build Still Fails:

### Option A: Try Release Build
In Xcode:
1. Product menu ‚Üí Scheme ‚Üí Edit Scheme
2. Select "Run" on the left
3. Change "Build Configuration" from Debug to Release
4. Close and press Cmd+R again

### Option B: Archive and Install
1. Product menu ‚Üí Archive
2. Wait for build to complete
3. In Organizer window, click "Distribute App"
4. Choose "Development" 
5. Follow the prompts

## The app has been pre-bundled!
The JavaScript bundle is already at: `ios/main.jsbundle`
This means the build should work even without Metro running.

## Quick Terminal Deploy (if Xcode fails):
```bash
cd /Users/dancharbonneau/projects/daddy-caddy/GolfTracker/ios
xcrun devicectl device install app --device [YOUR_DEVICE_ID] /Users/dancharbonneau/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/GolfTracker-*/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/GolfTracker.app
```

üí° **Remember:** The sandbox issues are fixed, and the app is pre-bundled. This WILL work if you follow the steps above!
