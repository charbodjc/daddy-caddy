## üõ† iOS Simulator Setup Fix

To run the app on iOS simulator, you need Xcode installed:

### Step 1: Install Xcode
```bash
# Option 1: Download from Mac App Store
# Search for "Xcode" and install (this is large, ~10GB)

# Option 2: Download from Apple Developer (faster)
# Visit: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
```

### Step 2: Set Xcode Command Line Tools
After Xcode is installed, run:
```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

### Step 3: Accept Xcode License
```bash
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

### Step 4: Install CocoaPods Dependencies
```bash
cd /Users/dancharbonneau/projects/daddy-caddy/GolfTracker/ios
pod install
cd ..
```

### Step 5: Run the App
```bash
# Run on default simulator
npm run ios

# Or run on specific device
npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 15"
```

## üì± Alternative: Run on Physical iPhone

If you don't want to install Xcode, you can run the app on your physical iPhone:
