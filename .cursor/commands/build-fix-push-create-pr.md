Following the .cursorrules and the cursor memories, please build for production to identify any potential deployment build errors and fix them. 
Then push changes to github and add to the existing PR or create a new one, making sure to check that the PR that you are adding to exists before adding to it. If it has already been merged with main, create a new PR. 
If you are creating a new PR tag it eas-build: (git tag eas-build)
Resolve any conflicts that arise from the PR. 
Do not merge with main. 
Let the user know the name and number of the PR and that is it ready for review.
