# Save Your Charbo Logo Here

Please save the Charbo logo image as:
```
/Users/dancharbonneau/projects/daddy-caddy/charbo_logo.png
```

Once you've saved the logo, run the icon generation script:
```bash
chmod +x /Users/dancharbonneau/projects/daddy-caddy/generate_app_icons.sh
/Users/dancharbonneau/projects/daddy-caddy/generate_app_icons.sh
```

This will generate all the required icon sizes for your iOS app.
